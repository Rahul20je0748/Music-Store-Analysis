## Database Schema

The database schema for this project includes the following tables:

- `Customers`: Contains information about the store's customers, including customer ID, name, email, and address.
- `Products`: Contains details about the products available in the store, including product ID, name, artist, and price.
- `Sales`: Contains transaction data, including sale ID, customer ID, product ID, sale date, and quantity.

## Project Files

The project consists of the following files:

- `music_store_analysis.sql`: SQL script containing the queries for data analysis.
- `README.md` (this file): Provides an overview of the project and instructions for use.

## SQL Queries

The `music_store_analysis.sql` script contains a set of SQL queries designed to answer various questions about the music store data. These queries cover a range of topics, including:

- Sales trends over time.
- Top-selling products and artists.
- Customer demographics.
- Revenue analysis.

To use these queries:

1. Set up a SQL database with the appropriate schema and data.
2. Execute the queries in the `music_store_analysis.sql` script in your SQL environment.
3. Analyze the results to gain insights into the music store's performance.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need access to a SQL database and an SQL client. Follow these steps:

1. **Set up a SQL Database**: Ensure you have a SQL database set up with the necessary tables based on the provided schema.

2. **Populate the Database**: Load your data into the database tables. You can use sample data or real data, depending on your requirements.

3. **Execute SQL Queries**: Open the `music_store_analysis.sql` script in your SQL client, connect to the database, and execute the SQL queries to extract insights.

## Usage

This project is designed to help you analyze the music store data. Customize and extend the SQL queries as needed to answer specific questions or perform additional analyses.
